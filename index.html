        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I believe that, when you learn programming it makes  something a lot easier for you and others around you. I'm a big believer in algorithms that allow you to solve problems in simple form, that later on you can use as a tool to solve more complex problems. The biggest thing I have seen or you have seen is Machine learning like a car that learns to drive or simply is like the game chess that you can play with as a person is playing with you.I can’t wait to see what can be created as a result of learning to program. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Searching for many years how to learn programer I found Coding Dojo where I was given assignment that need to be completed and go through morning algos every morning to help with code process through the many Instructors, TAs, classmates  that help me to understand what a programmer  would be facing in Industry of Tech or creating me own Application. I'm a graduate of Coding Dojo.

        <h2>Work History</h2>

        <h3> Chick-fil-A</h3>
        <p>
          I was most of the time cleaning tables if they needed me. I was given the opportunity to be a Cashier. I was given the task to ask Customers if their food was good the way they ordered it. Cleaning Tray makes sure that it has clean paper that they can eat on. Everywhere  Customer is enter was cleaned like Bathroom to tables and the playground was also selitized. 
        </p>
        <h3>Tractor-Supply</h3>
        <p>
        My task is to make sure that all of the animal food was stacked up by using their scanning system that tells how many quantities are in store, and also to help customers with loading their stock to vehicles by using Fork-left. If there is something that isn’t in store I would help them ording through the online order process and also
        by the backup Cashier.
        </p>
        <h3>1890</h3>
        <p>
          My task was to make sure that all of the plates were cleaned. As BarBack my task was to make sure that tables are cleaned as well as making customers feel welcomed and to help the Bar staff with anything that they need help on.
