        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’ve always been interested in how things work.  Especially computers, printers, and appliances.  My family would often ask me to try and fix the broken devices and machines around our house.  I really loved learning how to take things apart and put them back together again.  Sometimes, I’d be successful in making repairs in the process.  I was able to repair a Canon printer and my parents were amazed.  My first memory of interacting with computers goes back to my childhood when I was living in Ethiopia.  Playing computer games was fun, but I wanted to know more.  I had many questions like:  “How does the computer track with the keyboard and mouse?  What is programming and how is it done?”  I was adopted in 2009 at the age of 9, moved to the United States, and new opportunities quickly enabled me to give programming a try.  A small Raspberry Pi computer provided my first exposure to Computer Science, and I was hooked.  Since then, I’ve watched countless YouTube videos working to learn as much as possible about a variety of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>While searching for opportunities to learn programming in a more structured way, I learned about coding boot camps as a great alternative to traditional college courses.  I was most impressed by Coding Dojo and recently completed their Software Development Boot Camp as a full-time student.  This software engineering program enabled me to learn 3 full stacks in preparation for a coding career.  Each day was interesting with challenging assignments, morning algorithm drills to stimulate coding process skills and experienced Instructors, TAs, and classmates available to collaborate through the learning process.  That mentoring and teamwork helped me understand the industry expectations of a programmer and enabled me to prepare to begin my coding career.  I’m more excited than ever to continue working toward my goal of finding a great job in the industry.  I also look forward to continuing to learn and improve my skills.  </p>
