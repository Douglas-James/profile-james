        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I believe that, when you learn programming it makes  something a lot easier for you and others around you. I'm a big believer in algorithms that allow you to solve problems in simple form, that later on you can use as a tool to solve more complex problems. The biggest thing I have seen or you have seen is Machine learning like a car that learns to drive or simply is like the game chess that you can play with as a person is playing with you.I can’t wait to see what can be created as a result of learning to program. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Searching for many years how to learn programer I found Coding Dojo where I was given assignment that need to be completed and go through morning algos every morning to help with code process through the many Instructors, TAs, classmates  that help me to understand what a programmer  would be facing in Industry of Tech or creating me own Application. I'm a graduate of Coding Dojo.
